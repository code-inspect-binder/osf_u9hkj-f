Dear reader, 
attached you find the answers of our expert survey on CDR-CCS and the associated R code. Please note that some data were deleted from the original dataset in order to guarantee the anonymity of the experts. In particular, the age, the gender, the region of the main work place and the participation time were deleted. In the present dataset only answers of experts are included with a participation time above 5 minutes. 
Moreover, instead of detailed information regarding the job title and the academic background of experts, only the academic seniority groups and the academic background groups that were analyzed in the paper are included in the dataset. 
The R code can be used to reproduce the main findings of the paper. First, the items are checked for correlation as well as for the internal consistency and, then, mean values are calculated. Second, one-way ANOVAs without repeated measurement are conducted and, third, two multiple linear regression analyses (one for BECCS, one dor DACCS) are conducted. 
Below you find a description of every item of the base data (“survey_CDRCCS.txt”).
